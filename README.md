# AI-Powered-Range-Prediction-for-Electric-Vehicles
****1. Introduction:**
AI-Powered Range Prediction for Electric Vehicles is a smart system that uses artificial intelligence to accurately estimate how far an EV can travel based on real-time conditions. Unlike traditional range estimators that rely only on battery percentage, this project considers multiple parameters like driving behavior, terrain, temperature, and load to give users a more reliable range prediction.

****2. Problem Statement**
**Problem Context:**
EV drivers often face range anxiety due to inaccurate distance predictions. Current systems do not consider dynamic factors such as traffic, elevation, or weather conditions. This leads to unexpected battery depletion and driver inconvenience. The proposed system uses AI algorithms to predict EV range more precisely, improving user confidence and trip planning.

**3. Project Objectives**
1.Develop an AI model to predict real-time EV range accurately.
2.Collect and process data from sensors like GPS, temperature, and current sensors.
3.Consider driver behavior, load, and road conditions in predictions.
4.Display predicted range and efficiency through an interactive dashboard.
5.Enhance user trust and reduce range anxiety among EV owners.

**4. Key Features**
**AI-Based Prediction**:
Uses machine learning to estimate the remaining distance considering multiple real-time factors.
**Data Integration:**
Takes input from GPS, speed, temperature, and battery parameters for analysis.
**Real-Time Dashboard:**
Displays accurate range, energy usage, and alerts for low efficiency.
**Driver Behavior Analysis:**
Tracks acceleration, braking, and speed patterns to optimize energy consumption.
**Smart Alerts:**
Notifies users when the battery is low or when the route exceeds the predicted range.
